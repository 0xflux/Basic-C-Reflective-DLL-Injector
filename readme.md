# Reflective DLL Injector

This is a simple C fully reflective DLL injector, designed to inject a DLL packed into the executable. I have open sourced the very basic injector here, but in my [private repo](https://github.com/0xflux/Reflective-DLL-Injectors) there are a great many more features, including build pipelines & automation, fetching resources from URLs and advanced packing / encryption. 

Releasing this one open source as a basic POC, to be rewritten in Rust hopefully soon if have time.
